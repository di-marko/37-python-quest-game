# The Mathematical Labyrinth

You find yourself at the entrance of a mysterious labyrinth.
Legends say that the labyrinth was built by an ancient mathematician to hide a priceless treasure.
However, it's not beasts or traps that protect the treasure, but puzzles of logic and math.
To retrieve the treasure and safely exit, you'll need to solve the problems posed in each chamber of the maze.

# The Story and Decisions
## Introduction:
You find yourself at the entrance of a mysterious labyrinth. Legends say that the labyrinth was built by an ancient mathematician to hide a priceless treasure. However, it's not beasts or traps that protect the treasure, but puzzles of logic and math. To retrieve the treasure and safely exit, you'll need to solve the problems posed in each chamber of the maze.

### North:

Scene: A giant statue of Archimedes stands before you, holding a tablet that reads: "Find my number to proceed."

Puzzle: "I think of a number. I double it and then add 10. The result is 34. What's my number?"

Outcome:

    Correct Answer (12): A door behind the statue opens, revealing a passage. You proceed.
    Wrong Answer: The statue's eyes glow red. You feel compelled to try again.

### East:

Scene: A serene pool of water with Fibonacci spiral patterns. At the center, a pedestal emerges with a note.

Puzzle: "The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Every number after is the sum of the two preceding ones. What's the 5th number in this sequence?"

Outcome:

    Correct Answer (3): The water parts, allowing you to cross to the other side.
    Wrong Answer: The water churns violently. You realize you need to answer correctly to pass.

### South:

Scene: A garden filled with Pythagorean trees. A chalkboard stands with a triangle drawn, one side labeled 5, another labeled 12.

Puzzle: "I am the length of the hypotenuse. Who am I?"

Outcome:

    Correct Answer (13): The trees rearrange, creating a path forward.
    Wrong Answer: The trees seem to close in. You must find the right length to proceed.

### West:

Scene: A large observatory with celestial bodies depicted on the dome. A voice echoes, "Align the stars with the right equation."

Puzzle: "Which equation is true?

    1. 4^2 + 3^2 = 5^2
    2. 5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2
    3. 8^2 + 15^2 = 17^2

Outcome:

    Correct Answer (2): The stars align to form a constellation that points to the exit.
    Wrong Answer: The room darkens momentarily. The voice urges you to try again.

Win:
After navigating through all the chambers and solving the puzzles, you find yourself in the heart of the labyrinth. A chest of golden math instruments (compass, ruler, protractor) awaits - the legendary tools of ancient mathematicians. With the treasure in hand, you make your way out, realizing that knowledge and logic are the true treasures.
